/* A quick explanation on what you're just about to debug:
 * - we are running a state machine to trickle messages out to a small buffer
 * - we register a callback on DataFlash; it keeps calling this callback until it returns true; other WriteBlocks are blocked while this is happening.
 * - this callback is expected to be calling WriteBlock itself to add things
 * - WriteBlock may return false - hopefully indicating no space - in which case "false" is returned indicating "call me again"
 * - we are *chaining* these monsters; DataFlash wants to write out FMT and PARM messages, so we call a blockwriter over there, and when it is done we write out our own messages...
